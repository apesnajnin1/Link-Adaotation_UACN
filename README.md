Thesis Title: AMC Classification using Machine Learning and Rule-based Strategy for Underwater Acoustic Communications  Networks

Description:
We use PCA analysis to reduce the data size
Three Datasets are used here: Incheon Data (2 km), Taean Data (1 km), Taean Data (3 km) 
We find out the % of classification accuracy, also find out the threshold value for every single parameter
Also find out the 2d and 3d set of parameters which has maximum % of Accuracy, suitable for Real Time Implementation of Link Adaptation in UACN
We should consider energy limitation of sensor node under sea environment 
We do 1D, 2D, 3D, 11D and 18D analysis as a whole to compare the performances.
We draw confusion matrix, 2D scatter diagram, 3D, 4D interpollated plot to observe the data distribution
